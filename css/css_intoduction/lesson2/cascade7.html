    <h1 class="nav-head-2", id="site-brand-2"> Blue wins here over id, because of !important remark after the value of the shared property with the former 
        id selector. Never abuse of using !important. Still, red border from id is applied because it is no in conflict with nav-head-2 class selector, 
        and is more specific. </h1>
